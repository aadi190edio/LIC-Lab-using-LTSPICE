# Experiment 3 : Differential Amplifier â€“ Design in LTspice using 180 nm technology lib.

## Aim: To Design a basic diffrential amplifier for the following specificationVdd=3.3V,P<=3mW,Vincm=1.72V,Vocm=1.8V,Vp=0.7V,Perform DC Analysis,Transient analysis,AC Analysis and extract the required parameters.
