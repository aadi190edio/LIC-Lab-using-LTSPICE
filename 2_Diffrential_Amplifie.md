# Experiment 3 : Differential Amplifier â€“ Design in LTspice using 180 nm technology lib.

## Aim : 
To Design a basic diffrential amplifier for the following specificationVdd=3.3V,P<=3mW,Vincm=1.72V,Vocm=1.8V,Vp=0.7V,Perform DC Analysis,Transient analysis,AC Analysis and extract the required parameters.
## Components Required :
N-MOSFET,Resistors(),Power supply(),Current source().

## Theory : 
A differential amplifier amplifies the difference between two input voltages while rejecting common-mode signals. It is widely used in analog circuits for its noise rejection and balanced input handling.
